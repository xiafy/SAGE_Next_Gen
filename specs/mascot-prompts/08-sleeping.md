Generate a single illustration of my mascot character "Sage" — a cute teal bird chef for a dining app.

CRITICAL — Read these rules first:
- Output ONLY the character on a pure white background
- Do NOT include any text, labels, titles, annotations, or watermarks
- Do NOT include any grid lines, color swatches, size markers, or design notes
- Do NOT include any Chinese or English words anywhere in the image
- Do NOT include any parameter descriptions like "Feeling:", "Chef Hat:", "Blush:"
- The final image must contain NOTHING except the single bird character and its floating elements (if specified)

Character (match the attached reference image exactly):
- Cute round teal bird, body color #2EC4B6, cream belly #FFF5E6
- Orange beak and feet #E55A2B
- Small white chef hat, bowl-shaped cream apron #FFFACD with sage leaf embroidery
- Pear-shaped body, large round eyes with orange iris #FF6B35
- Short stubby wings with 3-segment feather tips
- Flat vector style, 2.5px dark charcoal outline #2D2D2D, solid color fills
- NO gradients, NO 3D effects, NO realistic textures, NO ground shadow

Pose and expression:
Emotion: Peacefully dozing off — a chef napping between the lunch and dinner rush. Completely at ease, adorable, makes you not want to disturb them. Cozy and serene.

Face details:
- Eyes peacefully closed — simple horizontal curved lines, relaxed (not squeezed, not focused — just softly shut in sleep)
- Eyebrows fully relaxed, maybe very slightly lowered
- Beak closed, neutral — the most relaxed possible mouth, maybe with a very faint content curve
- No strong blush — maybe the faintest hint of warmth (10% opacity, barely there)

Body pose:
- Both wings tucked in close to the body — wrapped around self in a cozy self-hug
- Wing tips might overlap slightly at the front/belly area
- Body leaning to one side (~8 degrees) — the natural tilt of someone nodding off
- Overall posture is compact and rounded — the character looks even rounder than usual because everything is tucked in
- Feet still visible at the bottom, close together

Accessories:
- Chef hat has slipped down from its normal position — covering or partially covering one eye area, tilted in the direction of the body lean
- This detail is important — it sells the "fell asleep" narrative
- Apron visible

Floating elements:
- Three "Z" letters floating above and to the side of the head, ascending diagonally
- Color: teal (#2EC4B6), matching the body color
- Size: decreasing from bottom to top (biggest Z closest to head, smallest Z furthest away)
- Style: simple, bold, rounded letters with the standard 2.5px outline
- One tiny circular bubble (like a sleep/dream bubble) floating from the corner of the beak — small, simple circle outline


Output requirements:
- Square canvas, 1024x1024 pixels
- Character centered horizontally and vertically
- Character fills about 70-80% of the canvas height
- Full body visible from hat to feet — NOTHING cropped or cut off
- Pure white background (#FFFFFF)
- PNG format
- Clean, production-ready asset — absolutely no annotations
