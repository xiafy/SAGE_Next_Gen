Generate a single illustration of my mascot character "Sage" — a cute teal bird chef for a dining app.

CRITICAL — Read these rules first:
- Output ONLY the character on a pure white background
- Do NOT include any text, labels, titles, annotations, or watermarks
- Do NOT include any grid lines, color swatches, size markers, or design notes
- Do NOT include any Chinese or English words anywhere in the image
- Do NOT include any parameter descriptions like "Feeling:", "Chef Hat:", "Blush:"
- The final image must contain NOTHING except the single bird character and its floating elements (if specified)

Character (match the attached reference image exactly):
- Cute round teal bird, body color #2EC4B6, cream belly #FFF5E6
- Orange beak and feet #E55A2B
- Small white chef hat, bowl-shaped cream apron #FFFACD with sage leaf embroidery
- Pear-shaped body, large round eyes with orange iris #FF6B35
- Short stubby wings with 3-segment feather tips
- Flat vector style, 2.5px dark charcoal outline #2D2D2D, solid color fills
- NO gradients, NO 3D effects, NO realistic textures, NO ground shadow

Pose and expression:
Emotion: Focused intellectual concentration — like a sommelier examining a wine label, or a chef carefully reading a complex recipe. Calm and composed, NOT anxious or worried. This is scholarly focus, not stress.

Face details:
- Eyes gently closed — two soft, peaceful downward-curving lines (like a serene "— —" shape)
- This is NOT eyes-shut-in-joy (那是 eating 表情), this is eyes-closed-in-thought
- Eyebrows slightly drawn together and lowered — a subtle studious furrow, conveying deep focus
- Beak closed with a neutral, contemplative line — not smiling, not frowning, just thoughtful
- No blush

Body pose:
- Left wing raised to the beak/chin area — the tip of the "index" feather touching the bottom of the beak, classic "The Thinker" pose by Rodin
- Right wing holding a small magnifying glass at mid-body height, angled downward as if examining something below
  - Magnifying glass design: circular lens with a very light blue tint (#D4E8F0), simple straight brown handle (#D4A76A), same 2.5px charcoal outline as the character
- Body very slightly leaned forward (~3 degrees) — the posture of someone peering closely at something
- Feet planted firmly, stable stance

Accessories:
- Chef hat straight and centered
- Apron visible

Floating elements:
- Three small circular dots "• • •" floating to the upper-right of the head
- Color: medium gray (#8E8E8E)
- Arranged in a gentle upward arc, evenly spaced
- These represent "processing/loading" — NOT a speech bubble, just freely floating dots


Output requirements:
- Square canvas, 1024x1024 pixels
- Character centered horizontally and vertically
- Character fills about 70-80% of the canvas height
- Full body visible from hat to feet — NOTHING cropped or cut off
- Pure white background (#FFFFFF)
- PNG format
- Clean, production-ready asset — absolutely no annotations
