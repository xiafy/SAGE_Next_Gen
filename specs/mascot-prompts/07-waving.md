Generate a single illustration of my mascot character "Sage" — a cute teal bird chef for a dining app.

CRITICAL — Read these rules first:
- Output ONLY the character on a pure white background
- Do NOT include any text, labels, titles, annotations, or watermarks
- Do NOT include any grid lines, color swatches, size markers, or design notes
- Do NOT include any Chinese or English words anywhere in the image
- Do NOT include any parameter descriptions like "Feeling:", "Chef Hat:", "Blush:"
- The final image must contain NOTHING except the single bird character and its floating elements (if specified)

Character (match the attached reference image exactly):
- Cute round teal bird, body color #2EC4B6, cream belly #FFF5E6
- Orange beak and feet #E55A2B
- Small white chef hat, bowl-shaped cream apron #FFFACD with sage leaf embroidery
- Pear-shaped body, large round eyes with orange iris #FF6B35
- Short stubby wings with 3-segment feather tips
- Flat vector style, 2.5px dark charcoal outline #2D2D2D, solid color fills
- NO gradients, NO 3D effects, NO realistic textures, NO ground shadow

Pose and expression:
Emotion: Warm, fond farewell — like a good friend seeing you off at the restaurant door after a wonderful meal. NOT sad, NOT overly cheerful. This is a gentle, intimate warmth — quieter and more tender than the "excited" expression.

Face details:
- Warm soft smile — beak curved up gently, closed mouth, serene
- Eyes OPEN but relaxed and slightly narrowed — the "smiling with your eyes" look (fond/affectionate gaze)
- Lower eyelids curve up slightly, creating that distinctive warm squint
- Eyebrows relaxed, soft, naturally following the gentle eye shape
- Noticeable but soft blush on cheeks (~25-30% opacity pink) — showing genuine warmth and fondness

Body pose:
- Right wing raised HIGH above the head — full extension, open palm facing outward, a clear and enthusiastic goodbye wave
- The wing is stretched to its full length, feather-tips spread apart
- Left wing down at waist level, gently touching or holding the edge of the apron — a polite, almost tender gesture
- Slight body lean to the left (~5 degrees) — a casual, relaxed farewell posture
- Feet visible, weight shifted slightly to the left foot matching the lean

Accessories:
- Chef hat straight, or tilted at most 3 degrees following the body lean
- Apron clearly visible, with left wing touching its edge

Floating elements:
- ONE small heart floating near the tip of the raised (right/waving) wing
- Heart style: orange (#FF6B35), OUTLINED only (not filled solid), 2.5px stroke
- Size: roughly the size of one of the character's eyes
- Position: floating just above and to the right of the waving wing's highest point


Output requirements:
- Square canvas, 1024x1024 pixels
- Character centered horizontally and vertically
- Character fills about 70-80% of the canvas height
- Full body visible from hat to feet — NOTHING cropped or cut off
- Pure white background (#FFFFFF)
- PNG format
- Clean, production-ready asset — absolutely no annotations
