Generate a single illustration of my mascot character "Sage" — a cute teal bird chef for a dining app.

CRITICAL — Read these rules first:
- Output ONLY the character on a pure white background
- Do NOT include any text, labels, titles, annotations, or watermarks
- Do NOT include any grid lines, color swatches, size markers, or design notes
- Do NOT include any Chinese or English words anywhere in the image
- Do NOT include any parameter descriptions like "Feeling:", "Chef Hat:", "Blush:"
- The final image must contain NOTHING except the single bird character and its floating elements (if specified)

Character (match the attached reference image exactly):
- Cute round teal bird, body color #2EC4B6, cream belly #FFF5E6
- Orange beak and feet #E55A2B
- Small white chef hat, bowl-shaped cream apron #FFFACD with sage leaf embroidery
- Pear-shaped body, large round eyes with orange iris #FF6B35
- Short stubby wings with 3-segment feather tips
- Flat vector style, 2.5px dark charcoal outline #2D2D2D, solid color fills
- NO gradients, NO 3D effects, NO realistic textures, NO ground shadow

Pose and expression:
Emotion: Genuinely puzzled — something unexpected happened and the character is trying to figure it out. Comic confusion, NOT distress. Think "a chef who accidentally added sugar instead of salt" — bewildered but not upset.

Face details:
- Head tilted 15 degrees to the right — the universal "huh?" gesture
- Eyes open but asymmetric: left eye noticeably larger/wider than right eye — classic cartoon confusion
- Eyebrows strongly asymmetric: left eyebrow raised HIGH, right eyebrow lowered and furrowed
- Beak slightly open with a small gap, neutral/uncertain curve — a subtle "uhh" expression
- No blush

Body pose:
- Left wing reaching up and behind the head — scratching the back of the head in confusion
- Right wing hanging at the side, palm facing upward in a small "I dunno" shrug gesture
- Body follows the head tilt slightly
- Feet planted but maybe slightly uneven (one foot slightly ahead)

Accessories:
- Chef hat askew — tilted to the LEFT (opposite direction to the head tilt), adding to the disheveled confused look
- Apron visible

Floating elements:
- One large "?" question mark floating above the head, centered
- Style: orange (#FF6B35) outline with 2.5px stroke matching the character's outline style
- Not filled solid — just an outlined question mark
- Size: roughly as tall as the character's head


Output requirements:
- Square canvas, 1024x1024 pixels
- Character centered horizontally and vertically
- Character fills about 70-80% of the canvas height
- Full body visible from hat to feet — NOTHING cropped or cut off
- Pure white background (#FFFFFF)
- PNG format
- Clean, production-ready asset — absolutely no annotations
