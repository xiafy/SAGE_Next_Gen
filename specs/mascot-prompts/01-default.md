Generate a single illustration of my mascot character "Sage" — a cute teal bird chef for a dining app.

CRITICAL — Read these rules first:
- Output ONLY the character on a pure white background
- Do NOT include any text, labels, titles, annotations, or watermarks
- Do NOT include any grid lines, color swatches, size markers, or design notes
- Do NOT include any Chinese or English words anywhere in the image
- Do NOT include any parameter descriptions like "Feeling:", "Chef Hat:", "Blush:"
- The final image must contain NOTHING except the single bird character and its floating elements (if specified)

Character (match the attached reference image exactly):
- Cute round teal bird, body color #2EC4B6, cream belly #FFF5E6
- Orange beak and feet #E55A2B
- Small white chef hat, bowl-shaped cream apron #FFFACD with sage leaf embroidery
- Pear-shaped body, large round eyes with orange iris #FF6B35
- Short stubby wings with 3-segment feather tips
- Flat vector style, 2.5px dark charcoal outline #2D2D2D, solid color fills
- NO gradients, NO 3D effects, NO realistic textures, NO ground shadow

Pose and expression:
Emotion: Calm, warm, welcoming — like a friendly neighborhood barista greeting a regular. NOT overly excited, NOT neutral/blank. Approachable confidence with a touch of warmth.

Face details:
- Gentle closed-mouth smile — beak curves softly upward, subtle and natural
- Eyes open and warm, looking directly at the viewer with a welcoming gaze
- Normal round pupils with standard white highlight at upper-right — no sparkles, no stars
- Eyebrows relaxed, very slightly raised — friendly but not surprised
- Very subtle blush on cheeks, barely visible (think 10% opacity soft pink)

Body pose:
- Right wing raised to shoulder height, open palm facing the viewer — a casual, relaxed "hi there" wave. The wave should feel effortless, not stiff.
- Left wing hanging naturally at the side, relaxed
- Body perfectly straight and centered, no lean or tilt — this is the baseline neutral posture
- Both feet visible, planted evenly on the ground

Accessories:
- Chef hat sitting perfectly straight and centered on head — no tilt whatsoever
- Bowl-shaped apron clearly visible and undisturbed
- NO held items — both wings are completely empty

Floating elements: NONE. This is the cleanest, most minimal expression. No music notes, no sparkles, no hearts, no symbols of any kind. Just the bird.


Output requirements:
- Square canvas, 1024x1024 pixels
- Character centered horizontally and vertically
- Character fills about 70-80% of the canvas height
- Full body visible from hat to feet — NOTHING cropped or cut off
- Pure white background (#FFFFFF)
- PNG format
- Clean, production-ready asset — absolutely no annotations
