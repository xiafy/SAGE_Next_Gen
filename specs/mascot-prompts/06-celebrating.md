Generate a single illustration of my mascot character "Sage" — a cute teal bird chef for a dining app.

CRITICAL — Read these rules first:
- Output ONLY the character on a pure white background
- Do NOT include any text, labels, titles, annotations, or watermarks
- Do NOT include any grid lines, color swatches, size markers, or design notes
- Do NOT include any Chinese or English words anywhere in the image
- Do NOT include any parameter descriptions like "Feeling:", "Chef Hat:", "Blush:"
- The final image must contain NOTHING except the single bird character and its floating elements (if specified)

Character (match the attached reference image exactly):
- Cute round teal bird, body color #2EC4B6, cream belly #FFF5E6
- Orange beak and feet #E55A2B
- Small white chef hat, bowl-shaped cream apron #FFFACD with sage leaf embroidery
- Pear-shaped body, large round eyes with orange iris #FF6B35
- Short stubby wings with 3-segment feather tips
- Flat vector style, 2.5px dark charcoal outline #2D2D2D, solid color fills
- NO gradients, NO 3D effects, NO realistic textures, NO ground shadow

Pose and expression:
Emotion: Triumphant celebration — the order card is ready, mission accomplished! A chef who just finished plating a perfect dish. Joy mixed with pride and accomplishment.

Face details:
- Eyes wide open and sparkling with joy — big, bright, full of energy
- Closed-mouth beaming smile — wide and proud, beak curved up strongly
- Eyebrows high and relaxed — pure happiness without any tension
- Optional light blush

Body pose:
- Right wing raised up, holding a pair of tiny crossed fork and knife — the symbol of dining success
  - Fork and knife: simple silver/gray (#C0C0C0) with 2.5px outline, crossed in an X shape
  - Held confidently above shoulder level
- Left wing raised in a classic fist pump gesture — bent at the elbow, fist near shoulder height
- Body has a slight energetic wiggle (convey this with 2-3 short curved motion lines around the torso)
- Feet planted firmly, proud stance

Accessories:
- Chef hat bouncing UP above the head — floating with a small curved arc/motion line above it
- Apron visible, maybe with a slight bounce

Floating elements:
- 4-5 small confetti particles scattered around the upper body and head area
- Mix of colors: orange (#FF6B35), teal (#2EC4B6), warm yellow (#FFBF69)
- Mix of shapes: small circles and tiny rectangles, at various angles
- Spread asymmetrically for a natural celebratory feel


Output requirements:
- Square canvas, 1024x1024 pixels
- Character centered horizontally and vertically
- Character fills about 70-80% of the canvas height
- Full body visible from hat to feet — NOTHING cropped or cut off
- Pure white background (#FFFFFF)
- PNG format
- Clean, production-ready asset — absolutely no annotations
