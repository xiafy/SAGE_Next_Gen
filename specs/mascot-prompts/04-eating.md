Generate a single illustration of my mascot character "Sage" — a cute teal bird chef for a dining app.

CRITICAL — Read these rules first:
- Output ONLY the character on a pure white background
- Do NOT include any text, labels, titles, annotations, or watermarks
- Do NOT include any grid lines, color swatches, size markers, or design notes
- Do NOT include any Chinese or English words anywhere in the image
- Do NOT include any parameter descriptions like "Feeling:", "Chef Hat:", "Blush:"
- The final image must contain NOTHING except the single bird character and its floating elements (if specified)

Character (match the attached reference image exactly):
- Cute round teal bird, body color #2EC4B6, cream belly #FFF5E6
- Orange beak and feet #E55A2B
- Small white chef hat, bowl-shaped cream apron #FFFACD with sage leaf embroidery
- Pear-shaped body, large round eyes with orange iris #FF6B35
- Short stubby wings with 3-segment feather tips
- Flat vector style, 2.5px dark charcoal outline #2D2D2D, solid color fills
- NO gradients, NO 3D effects, NO realistic textures, NO ground shadow

Pose and expression:
Emotion: Pure culinary bliss — just tasted the most incredible dish. That moment when flavor hits and everything else disappears. Serene, delicious satisfaction.

Face details:
- Eyes squeezed completely shut in happiness — upward-curving lines like ^_^ or the anime "happy closed eyes"
- This is eyes-shut-in-BLISS (different from thinking which is eyes-closed-in-focus — these curves go UP, not down)
- Strong rosy blush circles on both cheeks — soft pink (#FFB5B5), clearly visible, warm glow
- Beak closed with a deeply satisfied upward curve — the most content smile possible
- Eyebrows relaxed and slightly raised, following the happy eye shape

Body pose:
- Both wings raised to chest level, clasped together — a delighted, almost grateful gesture (like saying "oh my, this is divine")
- Fingers/feather-tips interlaced or pressed together
- Body straight or very slightly swaying
- Feet planted

Accessories:
- Chef hat tilted ~10 degrees to one side from the intensity of the flavor experience
- Apron visible

Floating elements:
- 2-3 tiny orange dots (#E55A2B) near the beak — food crumbs from tasting
- 2 small wavy steam lines rising from below the character — suggesting hot, aromatic food just out of frame


Output requirements:
- Square canvas, 1024x1024 pixels
- Character centered horizontally and vertically
- Character fills about 70-80% of the canvas height
- Full body visible from hat to feet — NOTHING cropped or cut off
- Pure white background (#FFFFFF)
- PNG format
- Clean, production-ready asset — absolutely no annotations
